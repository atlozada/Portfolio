This is a goofy website made with ASP.NET and C#. It was a series of lab assignments for an Advanced Web Programming course,
so the code may be a little disorganized and hastily written. Database access code was provided by the professor, Michael Cassens, as
that portion was outside the scope of the class at the time.

NOTE: This is NOT intended to show front-end development. It was a course on server-side development.
